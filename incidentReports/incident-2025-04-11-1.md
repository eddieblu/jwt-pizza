# Incident: 2025-04-11 16-32-40

## Summary

```md
Between the timeframe of at least 16:32 UTC and 16:45 UTC on 2025-04-11, a chaos test triggered a simulated failure in the external pizza factory service during order creation. The event was triggered by the injection of a valid reportPizzaCreationErrorToPizzaFactoryUrl value in the factory's error response. This simulated failure caused the system to return an error response (500), preventing the successful placement of orders during the test scenario.

A bug in this code caused the application to proceed with storing orders in the database even when the external pizza factory service failed to process them. This led to a mismatch between what the system believed was fulfilled and what actually reached the factory. 

The event was detected by alerts in Grafana, which were monitoring pizza creation in case of failure. The team began investigating the issue by verifying the injected failure URL and confirming the simulated chaos behavior. This low-severity incident affected 100% of simulated users during the chaos test window.

There was no further impact as noted by public attention raised by the simulated users in relation to this incident.
```

## Detection

```md
This incident was primarily detected manually, because our simulation team/OnCall team/Bethany Edwards  had forgotten to simulate traffic to the JWT pizza service. The team (still just Bethany Edwrads) manually created an order and noticed the failure, later creating enough order failures to trigger an alert.

It is unknown exactly how delayed the response was; however, more sensitive alerts will be set up by our team so that we can detect errors more quickly in the future and reduce manual intervention.
```

## Impact

```md
For at least 10 minutes between 16:32 UTC and 16:45 UTC on 2025-04-11, a chaos test triggered a simulated failure in the external pizza factory service during order creation.

This incident affected 100% of simulated customers (all the traffic generated during the test), who experienced failure responses when trying to place an order due to the factory serviceâ€™s simulated issue.

No support cases were raised since this was a test scenario, and no real customers were impacted.
```

## Timeline

```
All times are UTC.

- 16:32 - Failure identified by a manual test order placed
- 16:33 - Vulnerability explored by manually attempting to place more orders
- 16:34 - Alert triggered by Grafana and OnCall team notified (team was already aware of issue and was verifying if alerts worked)
- 16:40 - Injection URL identified in the code and error response
- 16:42 - Issue resolved
```

## Response

```
After manually encountering the failure at 16:32 UTC, the on-call developer responsible for the test started investigating the Grafana alerts at 16:33 UTC in an attempt to understand why no alert was sent. The developer manually triggered an alert by attempting to place more orders, and then went to the code to search for the issue.

This developer had not appropriately simulated site traffic for the chaost test, so the response was potentially much slower than needed which created a window of time for severe failure that will be avoided in the future. 
```

## Root cause

```
The incident was intentional: a chaos test designed to simulate an external factory failure. The root cause was an injected error response with a reporting URL. Removal of the potentially injected URL will prevent this incident from happening again. The purpose of this incident was to verify that the application could gracefully handle the failure and surface the proper diagnostic information.
```

## Resolution

```
The issue was resolved by removing the injected `reportPizzaCreationErrorToPizzaFactoryUrl` from the test payload. Once the injected URL was removed, order failures stopped occurring and the system resumed normal behavior during testing.

The incident was deemed over when new orders were successfully placed without triggering error responses, and Grafana alerts confirmed a return to expected order creation rates. To improve mitigation time in the future, we will ensure simulated traffic is running before starting chaos tests and set up earlier detection mechanisms with lower alert thresholds.
```

## Prevention

```
Although this incident was part of a chaos test, the underlying bug that allowed orders to be stored despite upstream failure had not been previously identified as a threat. This could also occur in a real failure scenario if the external service is down and the application does not verify success before storing data.

No previous incidents have been traced to this exact root cause, but this test highlights the need for stricter validation in real-world order workflows.
```

## Action items

```md
1. Add validation logic to prevent storing an order unless the external pizza factory service confirms successful processing. _(Assigned to: Bethany Edwards, due by: 2025-04-18)_
2. Improve alert sensitivity thresholds in Grafana to detect pizza order failures earlier. _(Assigned to: Platform Monitoring Team, due by: 2025-04-19)_
3. Ensure simulation traffic is automatically started as part of chaos test setup. _(Assigned to: Simulation Team, due by: 2025-04-20)_
4. Add a unit test to confirm that errors from external services prevent downstream persistence. _(Assigned to: QA Team, due by: 2025-04-21)_
